# Vandalgram

The idea was to relearn coding in PHP to create "Instagram style" app for graffiti writers, street artist,
street photographers etc. to post and share their work, photos with google maps pins.

Application should be the most simple it can be, collect only neccessary data to protect annonymmity of the 
users on the platform.

Started coding in php + javascript, but got discouraged because i found Node.js and started to explore newer
coding languages.
